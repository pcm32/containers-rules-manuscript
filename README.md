## Introduction

The ability to reproduce the original results of a scientific discovery has been one of the mayor challenges
in modern science. Evidences from multiple authors suggest that reproducibility in biomedical research is lower than 85% [PMID: 24411643], while 90% of researchers agree in a reproducibility crisis [PMID: 27225100]. One of the major drawbacks is to be able to reproduce the bioinformatics analysis, including the data processing and statistical downstream analysis [PMID: 24204232]. Different authors has pointed three main premises for reproducible bioinformatics software deplyoment: (i) the use of exact versions of software and tools, (ii) open source of the code and all custom software, (iii) adopt a licence and comply with the licence of third-party dependencies [PMID: 24204232, 28751965]. Most of these works has been focussed in the openness and availability of the tools, softwares, scripts and data to perform the bioinformatics analysis [PMID: 24204232, 27415786].

However, even if source code and data are published in a public repository (e.g Github) alongside the paper as open source artifacts, they come with many dependencies, configurations, versions that make their use hard to achieve [DOI:10.1145/2723872.2723882]. The build, installation and deployment of the bioinformatics solution (e.g. software or workflow) often requires internal knowledge that is missing from the published manuscript. In addition, most of the bioinformatics software is developed by different teams but used in combination thorugth workflows, scripts or pipelines. This adds an additional layer of complexity that introduce challenges for dependency compatibilities, serial and parallel steps, varied software data file types and user-defined parameters.

Software containers has emerged as a powerful technology to documment, distribute, and deploy bioinformatics software [PMID: 28379341]. Containers are easily packaged, lightweight software components and libraries designed to run anywhere [PMID: 28379341]. Among different options Conda packages, Docker and Singularity containers are promising technologies for the field of computational biology and bioinformatics software reproducibility. The BioContainers and BioConda communities released more than 3000 containers [PMID: 28379341] for bioinformatics community enabling the development of complex and reproducbles workflows and pipeines [PMID: 28559010, PMID: 27137889].

This manuscript describes a core set of recommendations and guidelines to improve the quality and sustainability of research software based on software containers. It provides easy-to-implement recommendations that encourage adoption of containers technologies in bioinformatics and software development for research. It provides recomendations about making research software and its source code more reproducible, deployable, reusable, transparent and more compatible with other tools and software.

In this manuscript, software is broadly defined to include command line tools, graphical user interfaces, application program interfaces (APIs), infrastructure scripts and software packages (e.g. R packages).

### 1. One tool, one container.

Microservice and modular architecutres [DOI: 10.1109/MS.2016.64] is a way of breaking large software projects into smaller, independent, and loosely coupled modules. This software applications can be seen as a suite of independently deployable, small, modular components in which each tool runs a **unique** process and communicates through a well-defined, lightweight mechanism to serve a business goal [DOI: 10.4103/2153-3539.194835]. Each of these indeppendent modules are referred to as a _container_.  A container is essentially an encapsulated and immutable version of an application, coupled with the bare-minimum operating system components (e.g. dependencies) required for execution [PMID: 28379341].

Containers should be defined as mosr granulaer as possible with the premise _one Tool, one Container_. Each container should encapsulate only one piece of software, tool that perform a unique task with a weel-define goal (e.g. sequence alligner, mass spectra identification). In order to design the level of _granularity_, different metrics should be consider:

- _Lower complexity_: the encapsulated software shouldn't be a complex enviroment of dependencies, tools and scripts.
- _Reusability_: a tool condainer can be safely reused by any other workflow component or tasks through its access interface.
- _Interoperability_: different tools can be easily connected.
- _Maintainability_: the mainteiners of the software component should be take into account. If multiple tools comming from multiple teams and developers is added to the same container it makes their mantenability more complex.
- _Userâ€™s acceptability_:  tool container encapsulates domain business process units, so it can be more easily checked and used.
- _Container Size_: An important factor to define the granularity of a container is the size. Smaller containers are much quicker to download the image from registries and therefore it can be distributed to different machines much quicker. Less code/less programs in the container means less attack surface.

### 2. Choose a base image wisely.

One of the decisions that will most likely impact on your final container image size will be your base image. If you can, start with a lightweight base image such as Alpine or similar, always at a fixed version. If installing your software on top of such a minimal operating system doesn't work out well, only then move to a larger, stock-image where installation of your tool software might be simpler (such as Ubuntu). Preferring stock images means that many other people will be using them and that your container will be pulled faster as shared layers are more likely. Always aim to have predefined images from where you choose (always the same Alpine version as first choice and always the same Ubuntu version as second choice), so that most of your containers share that base image.

### 3. Versions should be explicit, and consider both the tool version and the container vesion

The tool or software wrapped inside the container should be fixed explicitly to a defined version through the mechanism available by the package manager or install method used. The version used for this main software should be included both in the metadata of the container (for findability reasons) and in the tag. The tag and metadata of the container should also include a versioning number for the container itself, meaning that the tag could look like `v<version-of-the-tool>_cv<version-of-the-container>`. The container version, which tracks changes to the container itself, but not the tool, should be versioned through semantic versioning ideally, to signal backward compatibility/incompatibility when this applies.

### 4. Eschew ENTRYPOINT

### 5. More Metadata

### 6. When possible first a package and then a container.

Package managers automate the installation of complex sets of software packages. _Conda_, the most popular package manager in research software, quickly installs, runs and updates packages and their dependencies. It handles dependencies for many languages such as C, C++, R, Java and of course Python tools. In addition, _Conda_ has join to other popular packages manager systems such as Gentoo, BSD Ports, MacPorts, and Homebrew which build packages from source instead of installing from a pre-built binary.

You can create a _Conda_ package by defining a _BioConda_ recipe (**Box 1**). This recipe (https://github.com/bioconda/bioconda-recipes) contains enougth information about the dependencies, the LICENSE and fundamental metadata to find, retrieve and use the package (see **Recomendation X**). The _BioConda_ package can be use in any with any Python installation and the BioContainers project [PMID: 28379341] has developed an automatic system to build software containers for multiple technolgies such as Docker, rkt or Singularity [PMID: 28494014].

### 7. Relevant tools and software should be executable and in the path

If for some reason the container needs to expose more than a single executable or script (for instance, EMBOSS or other packages with many executables), these should always be executable and be available in the container's default path. This will be mostly always the case by default for everything that is installed via a package manager (apt-get, pip, R install.package, etc) and you won't need to worry if that is the case, but if you are adding tailored made scripts or others that are not installed through a manager, then you need to take care of this. This will facilitate the use of the container as an environment or to specify alternative commands to the main entrypoint easily.

### 8. Reduce the size of your container as much as possible

Since containers are being constantly being pushed and pulled over the internet, their size matters. There are many tips to reduce the size of your container in build time:
- Avoid instaling "recommended" packages in apt based systems.
- Do not keep build tools in the image: this includes compilers and development libraries that will seldomly, if not at all, used in runtime when your container is being used by others. For instance, packages like gcc can use several hundreds megabytes. This also applies to tools like git, wget or curl, which you might have used to retrieve software during container buildtime, but are not needed for runtime. 
- Make sure you clean caches, uneeded downloads and temporary files.
- In Dockerfiles, combine multiple RUNs so that the initial packages installations and the final deletions (of compilers, development libraries and caches/temporary files) are left within the same layer.
- If installing or cloning from a git repo, use shallow clones, which for large repos will save a lot of space.
